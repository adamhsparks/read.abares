An R package for automated downloading, parsing and formatting of data from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences including the:

- [Historical National Estimates, Historical State Estimates, Historical Regional Estimates,
Estimates by Size, Estimates by Performance Category](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/data/farm-data-portal#data-download);
- the [Australian Gridded Farm Data (AGFD) set](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-survey-data/australian-gridded-farm-data); and the
- [Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS)](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-survey-data) region mapping files.

The files are freely available as CSV files, zip archives of NetCDF files or a zip archive of a geospatial shape file.
{abares} facilitates downloading, caching and importing these files in your R session with your choice of the class of the resulting object(s).

## Get Started

### Installation

{abares} is not available through CRAN (yet).
But you can install it like so:

```r
if (!require("remotes"))
  install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_git("https://codeberg.org/adamhsparks/abares")
```

## Features

### Caching

{abares} supports caching the files using `tools::R_user_dir(package = "abares", which = "cache")` to save the files in a standardised location across platforms so you don't have to worry about where the files went or if they're still there.
When requesting the files, {abares} will first check if they are available locally.
Caching is not mandatory, you can just work with the downloaded files in `tempdir()`, which is cleaned up when your R session ends.
`get_agfd()` will always check first if the files are available locally, either cached or in your current R session's `tempdir()` to save time by not downloading again if they are available already.

### Multiple Classes Supported

{abares} supports multiple classes of objects to support your workflow.
Select from spatial classes:

- [{stars}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stars),
- [{terra}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=terra) or
- [{tidync}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidync)

or data.frame objects:

- [{data.table}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table)
