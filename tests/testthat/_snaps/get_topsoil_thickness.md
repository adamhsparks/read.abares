      -- Dataset ANZLIC ID ANZCW1202000149 --
      
      Feature attribute definition Predicted average Thickness (mm) of soil layer 1
      in the 0.01 X 0.01 degree quadrat.
      
      Custodian: CSIRO Land & Water
      
      Jurisdiction Australia
      
      Short Description The digital map data is provided in geographical coordinates
      based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum. This raster data set has
      a grid resolution of 0.001 degrees (approximately equivalent to 1.1 km).
      
      The data set is a product of the National Land and Water Resources Audit
      (NLWRA) as a base dataset.
      
      Data Type: Spatial representation type RASTER
      
      Projection Map: projection GEOGRAPHIC
      
      Datum: WGS84
      
      Map Units: DECIMAL DEGREES
      
      Scale: Scale/ resolution 1:1 000 000
      
      Usage Purpose Estimates of soil depths are needed to calculate the amount of
      any soil constituent in either volume or mass terms (bulk density is also
      needed) - for example, the volume of water stored in the rooting zone
      potentially available for plant use, to assess total stores of soil carbon for
      greenhouse inventory or to assess total stores of nutrients.
      
      Provide indications of probable thickness soil layer 1 in agricultural areas
      where soil thickness testing has not been carried out.
      
      Use Limitation: This dataset is bound by the requirements set down by the
      National Land & Water Resources Audit
      To see the full metadata, call `print_topsoil_thickness_metadata()` on a soil
      thickness object in your R session.
