{read.abares} provides a number of global options that can be set to control the behavior of the package.
These options can be set using the `options()` function in R, but a helper function, `read.abares_options()` is provided for more direct access and convenience.

By default data downloads are cached in R's `tempdir()` and cleaned up upon exiting the active session.
You may enable caching for some of the larger data files to save time in the future by not downloading the files again.
This obviously is a personal decision, many R users would look to {[targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/)} to manage their workflow, or you may simply prefer to fetch the data and write it to disk yoursel to manage their workflow, or you may simply prefer to fetch the data and write it to disk yourselff
