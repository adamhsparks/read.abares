This vignette demonstrates some of the functionality of {read.abares} and how to work with some of the spatial and tabular data available through {read.abares}.
Please note that not all functions are demonstrated here, please refer to the [documentation reference](https://adamhsparks.github.io/read.abares/reference/) for a full list of functionality.
The worked examples here show some of the more advanced features that {read.abares} offers beyond just fetching and importing data, _e.g._, Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS) spatial shapefile which can be used with tabular data from the historical estimates, the Australian Gridded Farm Data, which can be downloaded, cached and then imported using one of four types of object or the soil thickness data, which includes rich metadata.

First we need to load the {read.abares} library.


``` r
library(read.abares)
```

## Working with AAGIS Regions Spatial Data

### Obtaining the AAGIS Regions Spatial Data

ABARES offers spatial data for the Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS) regions that can be used for mapping tabular data from the estimates, _e.g._, `read_historical_regional_estimates()` or `read_state_estimates()`.


``` r
aagis_regions <- read_aagis_regions(cache = TRUE)

plot(aagis_regions)
```

![plot of chunk aagis-regions](aagis-regions-1.png)

### Obtaining AAGIS Data by Region

{read.abares} offers functions to download the ABARES estimates based on the AAGIS results for national level, `read_historical_national_estimates()`, regional level `read_historical_regional_estimates()`, and state level `read_historical_state_estimates()` and also by performance category `read_estimates_by_performance_category()` and size category `read_estimates_by_size()`.
For this example, we will use the `read_historical_regional_estimates()` function to download the AAGIS data for the regions in the AAGIS regions shapefile and join the data and visualise some of the data.


``` r
aagis_region_data <- read_historical_regional_estimates()
```

### Merging the AAGIS Regions Spatial Data with the AAGIS Regional Data

Using `read_aagis_regions()` and `read_historical_regional_estimates()`, we can merge the two datasets together to visualise the data.
To join the data, we will use the `left_join()` function from the {dplyr} package.


``` r
library(dplyr)

aagis_dat <- left_join(aagis_regions, aagis_region_data)
```

```
## Joining with `by = join_by(ABARES_region)`
```

Once we've joined the data, we can visualise it using {ggplot2}.
Here we can plot the total area cropped (ha) and facet by year for all of Australia.


``` r
library(ggplot2)

total_area <- filter(aagis_dat, Variable == ("Total area cropped (ha)"))

ggplot(total_area) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = Value)) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(
    fill = "Total Area Cropped (ha)",
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~Year) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Working With AGFD Data

You can download files and pipe directly into the class object that you desire for the Australian Farm Gridded Data (AGFD) data.

### Description of the Australian Farm Gridded Data

Directly from the DAFF website:

>The Australian Gridded Farm Data are a set of national scale maps containing simulated data on historical broadacre farm business outcomes including farm profitability on an 0.05-degree (approximately 5 km) grid.

>These data have been produced by read.abares as part of the ongoing Australian Agricultural Drought Indicator (AADI) project (previously known as the Drought Early Warning System Project) and were derived using read.abares farmpredict model, which in turn is based on read.abares Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS) data.

>These maps provide estimates of farm business profit, revenue, costs and production by location (grid cell) and year for the period 1990-91 to 2022-23. The data do not include actual observed outcomes but rather model predicted outcomes for representative or ‘typical' broadacre farm businesses at each location considering likely farm characteristics and prevailing weather conditions and commodity prices.

>The Australian Gridded Farm Data remain under active development, and as such should be considered experimental.

Load the {read.abares} library.


``` r
library(read.abares)
```

Check the file format information for the NetCDF files.


``` r
print_agfd_nc_file_format()
```

```
## ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

```
## Each of the layers in simulation output data is represented as a 2D raster in
## NETCDF files, with the following grid format:
```

```
## CRS: EPSG:4326 - WGS 84 - Geographic
```

```
## Extent: 111.975 -44.525 156.275 -9.975
```

```
## Unit: Degrees
```

```
## Width: 886
```

```
## Height: 691

Download or load from the local cache and read the AGFD files as a list of {stars} objects.


``` r
## A list of {stars} objects
star <- get_agfd(cache = TRUE) |>
  read_agfd_stars()
```

```
## Will return stars object with 612226 cells.
```

```
## No projection information found in nc file. 
##  Coordinate variable units found to be degrees, 
##  assuming WGS84 Lat/Lon.
```

``` r

## Working With the Soil Thickness Map

You can download the soil depth map and import it as a {stars} or [terra::rast()] object.


``` r
library(read.abares)
get_topsoil_thickness(cache = TRUE) |>
  read_topsoil_thickness_stars()
```

```
## stars object with 2 dimensions and 1 attribute
## attribute(s), summary of first 100000 cells:
##         Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max.   NA's
## thpk_1    NA      NA     NA  NaN      NA   NA 100000
## dimension(s):
##   from   to offset delta refsys x/y
## x    1 4150  112.5  0.01 WGS 84 [x]
## y    1 3401 -9.995 -0.01 WGS 84 [y]
```

``` r
x <- get_topsoil_thickness(cache = TRUE) |>
  read_topsoil_thickness_terra()
```

For your convenience, {read.abares} re-exports [terra::plot()], so you can just use `plot()` with the {terra} objects in {read.abares}.


``` r
plot(x)
```

## Description Abstract Surface of predicted Thickness of soil layer 1 (A Horizon
## - top-soil) surface for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.  Data
## modelled from area based observations made by soil agencies both State and
## CSIRO and presented as .0.01 degree grid cells.
## 
## Topsoils (A horizons) are defined as the surface soil layers in which organic
## matter accumulates, and may include dominantly organic surface layers (O and P
## horizons).
## 
## The depth of topsoil is important because, with their higher organic matter
## contents, topsoils (A horizon) generally have more suitable properties for
## agriculture, including higher permeability and higher levels of soil nutrients.
## 
## Estimates of soil depths are needed to calculate the amount of any soil
## constituent in either volume or mass terms (bulk density is also needed) - for
## example, the volume of water stored in the rooting zone potentially available
## for plant use, to assess total stores of soil carbon for Greenhouse inventory
## or to assess total stores of nutrients.
## 
## The pattern of soil depth is strongly related to topography - the shape and
## slope of the land.  Deeper soils are typically found in the river valleys where
## soils accumulate on floodplains and at the footslopes of ranges (zones of
## deposition), while soils on hillslopes (zones of erosion) tend to be shallow.
## Map of thickness of topsoil was derived from soil map data and interpreted
## tables of soil properties for specific soil groups.
## 
## The quality of data on soil depth in existing soil profile datasets is
## questionable and as the thickness of soil horizons varies locally with
## topography, values for map units are general averages.
## 
## The final ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces are a mosaic of all of the data
## obtained from various state and federal agencies. The surfaces have been
## constructed with the best available soil survey information available at the
## time. The surfaces also rely on a number of assumptions. One being that an area
## weighted mean is a good estimate of the soil attributes for that polygon or
## map-unit. Another assumption made is that the look-up tables provided by
## McKenzie et al. (2000), state and territories accurately depict the soil
## attribute values for each soil type.
## 
## The accuracy of the maps is most dependent on the scale of the original polygon
## data sets and the level of soil survey that has taken place in each state.  The
## scale of the various soil maps used in deriving this map is available by
## accessing the data-source grid, the scale is used as an assessment of the
## likely accuracy of the modelling.  The Atlas of Australian Soils is considered
## to be the least accurate dataset and has therefore only been used where there
## is no state based data.  Of the state datasets Western Australian sub-systems,
## South Australian land systems and NSW soil landscapes and reconnaissance
## mapping would be the most reliable based on scale. NSW soil landscapes and
## reconnaissance mapping use only one dominant soil type per polygon in the
## estimation of attributes.  South Australia and Western Australia use several
## soil types per polygon or map-unit.
##

## Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum. This raster data set has a grid resolution
## of 0.001 degrees (approximately equivalent to 1.1 km).

## Data Quality Lineage The soil attribute surface was created using the following
## datasets 1. The digital polygon coverage of the Soil-Landforms of the Murray
## Darling Basis (MDBSIS)(Bui et al. 1998), classified as principal profile forms
## (PPF's) (Northcote 1979). 2. The digital Atlas of Australian Soils (Northcote
## et al.1960-1968)(Leahy, 1993). 3. Western Australia land systems coverage
## (Agriculture WA). 4. Western Australia sub-systems coverage (Agriculture WA).
## 5. Ord river catchment soils coverage (Agriculture WA). 6. Victoria soils
## coverage (Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment - NRE). 7.
## NSW Soil Landscapes and reconnaissance soil landscape mapping (NSW Department
## of Land and Water Conservation - DLWC). 8. New South Wales Land systems west
## (NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation - DLWC). 9. South Australia soil
## land-systems (Primary Industries and Resources South Australia - PIRSA). 10.
## Northern Territory soils coverage (Northern Territory Department of Lands,
## Planning and Environment). 11. A mosaic of Queensland soils coverages
## (Queensland Department of Natural Resources - QDNR). 12. A look-up table
## linking PPF values from the Atlas of Australian Soils with interpreted soil
## attributes (McKenzie et al. 2000). 13. Look_up tables provided by WA
## Agriculture linking WA soil groups with interpreted soil attributes. 14.
## Look_up tables provided by PIRSA linking SA soil groups with interpreted soil
## attributes.
## 
## The continuous raster surface representing Thickness of soil layer 1 was
## created by combining national and state level digitised land systems maps and
## soil surveys linked to look-up tables listing soil type and corresponding
## attribute values.
## 
## Because thickness is used sparingly in the Factual Key, estimations of
## thickness in the look-up tables were made using empirical correlations for
## particular soil types.
## 
## To estimate a soil attribute where more than one soil type was given for a
## polygon or map-unit, the soil attribute values related to each soil type in the
## look-up table were weighted according to the area occupied by that soil type
## within the polygon or map-unit. The final soil attribute values are an area
## weighted average for a polygon or map-unit.  The polygon data was then
## converted to a continuous raster surface using the soil attribute values
## calculated for each polygon.
## 
## The ASRIS soil attribute surfaces created using polygon attribution relied on a
## number of data sets from various state agencies.  Each polygon data set was
## turned into a continuous surface grid based on the calculated soil attribute
## value for that polygon.  The grids where then merged on the basis that, where
## available, state data replaced the Atlas of Australian Soils and MDBSIS.
## MDBSIS derived soil attribute values were restricted to areas where MDBSIS was
## deemed to be more accurate that the Atlas of Australian Soils (see Carlile et
## al (2001a).
## 
## In cases where a soil type was missing from the look-up table or layer 2 did
## not exist for that soil type, the percent area of the soils remaining were
## adjusted prior to calculating the final soil attribute value. The method used
## to attribute polygons was dependent on the data supplied by individual State

Soil Thickness for Australian areas of intensive agriculture of Layer 1 (A Horizon - top-soil) (derived from soil mapping)

Description
Abstract
Surface of predicted Thickness of soil layer 1 (A Horizon - top-soil) surface for the intensive agricultural areas of Australia.  Data modelled from area based observations made by soil agencies both State and CSIRO and presented as .0.01 degree grid cells.

Topsoils (A horizons) are defined as the surface soil layers in which organic matter accumulates, and may include dominantly organic surface layers (O and P horizons).

The depth of topsoil is important because, with their higher organic matter contents, topsoils (A horizon) generally have more suitable properties for agriculture, including higher permeability and higher levels of soil nutrients.

Estimates of soil depths are needed to calculate the amount of any soil constituent in either volume or mass terms (bulk density is also needed) - for example, the volume of water stored in the rooting zone potentially available for plant use, to assess total stores of soil carbon for Greenhouse inventory or to assess total stores of nutrients.

The pattern of soil depth is strongly related to topography - the shape and slope of the land.  Deeper soils are typically found in the river valleys where soils accumulate on floodplains and at the footslopes of ranges (zones of deposition), while soils on hillslopes (zones of erosion) tend to be shallow. 
Map of thickness of topsoil was derived from soil map data and interpreted tables of soil properties for specific soil groups.

The quality of data on soil depth in existing soil profile datasets is questionable and as the thickness of soil horizons varies locally with topography, values for map units are general averages.

The final ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces are a mosaic of all of the data obtained from various state and federal agencies. The surfaces have been constructed with the best available soil survey information available at the time. The surfaces also rely on a number of assumptions. One being that an area weighted mean is a good estimate of the soil attributes for that polygon or map-unit. Another assumption made is that the look-up tables provided by McKenzie et al. (2000), state and territories accurately depict the soil attribute values for each soil type.

The accuracy of the maps is most dependent on the scale of the original polygon data sets and the level of soil survey that has taken place in each state.  The scale of the various soil maps used in deriving this map is available by accessing the data-source grid, the scale is used as an assessment of the likely accuracy of the modelling.  The Atlas of Australian Soils is considered to be the least accurate dataset and has therefore only been used where there is no state based data.  Of the state datasets Western Australian sub-systems, South Australian land systems and NSW soil landscapes and reconnaissance mapping would be the most reliable based on scale. NSW soil landscapes and reconnaissance mapping use only one dominant soil type per polygon in the estimation of attributes.  South Australia and Western Australia use several soil types per polygon or map-unit.

The digital map data is provided in geographical coordinates based on the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum. This raster data set has a grid resolution of 0.001 degrees  (approximately equivalent to 1.1 km).

The data set is a product of the National Land and Water Resources Audit (NLWRA) as a base dataset.

Lineage
The soil attribute surface was created using the following datasets
1. The digital polygon coverage of the Soil-Landforms of the Murray Darling Basis (MDBSIS)(Bui et al. 1998), classified as principal profile forms (PPF's) (Northcote 1979).
2. The digital Atlas of Australian Soils (Northcote et al.1960-1968)(Leahy, 1993).
3. Western Australia land systems coverage (Agriculture WA).
4. Western Australia sub-systems coverage (Agriculture WA).
5. Ord river catchment soils coverage (Agriculture WA).
6. Victoria soils coverage (Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment - NRE).
7. NSW Soil Landscapes and reconnaissance soil landscape mapping (NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation
- DLWC).
8. New South Wales Land systems west (NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation - DLWC).
9. South Australia soil land-systems (Primary Industries and Resources South Australia - PIRSA).
10. Northern Territory soils coverage (Northern Territory Department of Lands, Planning and Environment).
11. A mosaic of Queensland soils coverages (Queensland Department of Natural Resources - QDNR).
12. A look-up table linking PPF values from the Atlas of Australian Soils with interpreted soil attributes (McKenzie et al. 2000).
13. Look_up tables provided by WA Agriculture linking WA soil groups with interpreted soil attributes.
14. Look_up tables provided by PIRSA linking SA soil groups with interpreted soil attributes.

The continuous raster surface representing Thickness of soil layer 1 was created by combining national and state level digitised land systems maps and soil surveys linked to look-up tables listing soil type and corresponding attribute values.

Because thickness is used sparingly in the Factual Key, estimations of thickness in the look-up tables were made using empirical correlations for particular soil types.

To estimate a soil attribute where more than one soil type was given for a polygon or map-unit, the soil attribute values related to each soil type in the look-up table were weighted according to the area occupied by that soil type within the polygon or map-unit. The final soil attribute values are an area weighted average for a polygon or map-unit.  The polygon data was then converted to a continuous raster surface using the soil attribute values calculated for each polygon.

The ASRIS soil attribute surfaces created using polygon attribution relied on a number of data sets from various state agencies.  Each polygon data set was turned into a continuous surface grid based on the calculated soil attribute value for that polygon.  The grids where then merged on the basis that, where available, state data replaced the Atlas of Australian Soils and MDBSIS.  MDBSIS derived soil attribute values were restricted to areas where MDBSIS was deemed to be more accurate that the Atlas of Australian Soils (see Carlile et al (2001a).

In cases where a soil type was missing from the look-up table or layer 2 did not exist for that soil type, the percent area of the soils remaining were adjusted prior to calculating the final soil attribute value. The method used to attribute polygons was dependent on the data supplied by individual State agencies.

The modelled grid was resampled from 0.0025 degree cells to 0.01 degree cells using bilinear interpolation

Positional Accuracy
The predictive surface is a 0.01 X 0.01 degree grid and has a locational accurate of about 1m.

The positional accuracy of the defining polygons have variable positional accuracy most locations are expected to be within 100m of the recorded location.  The vertical accuracy is not relevant. The positional assessment has been made by considering the tools used to generate the locational information and contacting the data providers.

 The other parameters used in the production of the led surface have a range of positional accuracy ranging from + - 50 m to + - kilometres.  This contribute to the loss of attribute accuracy in the surface.

Attribute Accuracy
Input attribute accuracy for the areas is highly variable.  The predictive has a variable and much lower attribute accuracy due to the irregular distribution and the limited positional accuracy of the parameters used for modelling.

There are several sources of error in estimating soil depth and thickness of horizons for the look-up tables.  Because thickness is used sparingly in the Factual Key, estimations of thickness in the look-up tables were made using empirical correlations for particular soil types.  The quality of data on soil depth in existing soil profile datasets is questionable, in soil mapping, thickness of soil horizons varies locally with topography, so values for map units are general averages.  The definition of the depth of soil or regolith is imprecise and it can be difficult to determine the lower limit of soil.

The assumption made that an area weighted mean of soil attribute values based on soil type is a good estimation of a soil property is debatable, in that it does not supply the soil attribute value at any given location. Rather it is designed to show national and regional patterns in soil properties. The use of the surfaces at farm or catchment scale modelling may prove inaccurate. Also the use of look-up tables to attribute soil types is only as accurate as the number of observations used to estimate a attribute value for a soil type. Some soil types in the look-up tables may have few observations, yet the average attribute value is still taken as the attribute value for that soil type. Different states are using different taxonomic schemes making a national soil database difficult.
Another downfall of the area weighted approach is that some soil types may not be listed in look-up tables. If a soil type is a dominant one within a polygon or map-unit, but is not listed within the look-up table or is not attributed within the look-up table then the final soil attribute value for that polygon will be biased towards the minor soil types that do exist. This may also happen when a large area is occupied by a soil type which has no B horizon. In this case the final soil attribute value will be area weighted on the soils with a B horizon, ignoring a major soil type within that polygon or map-unit. The layer 2 surfaces have large areas of no-data because all soils listed for a particular map-unit or polygon had no B horizon.

Logical Consistency
Surface is fully logically consistent as only one parameter is shown, as predicted average Soil Thickness within each grid cell 

Completeness
Surface is nearly complete.  There are some areas (about %1 missing) for which insufficient parameters were known to provide a useful prediction and thus attributes are absent in these areas.
