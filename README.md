# {agfd}: Simple downloading and importing of the Australian Gridded Farm Data

An R package for automated downloading, parsing and formatting of [Australian Gridded Farm Data](https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-survey-data/australian-gridded-farm-data) from Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF).

## Description of the Data

Directly from the DAFF website:

>The Australian Gridded Farm Data are a set of national scale maps containing simulated data on historical broadacre farm business outcomes including farm profitability on an 0.05-degree (approximately 5 km) grid.

>These data have been produced by ABARES as part of the ongoing Australian Agricultural Drought Indicator (AADI) project (previously known as the Drought Early Warning System Project) and were derived using ABARES farmpredict model, which in turn is based on ABARES Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey (AAGIS) data.

>These maps provide estimates of farm business profit, revenue, costs and production by location (grid cell) and year for the period 1990-91 to 2022-23. The data do not include actual observed outcomes but rather model predicted outcomes for representative or ‘typical’ broadacre farm businesses at each location considering likely farm characteristics and prevailing weather conditions and commodity prices.

>The Australian Gridded Farm Data remain under active development, and as such should be considered experimental.
