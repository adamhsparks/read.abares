Dataset ANZLIC ID ANZCW1202000149 Title Soil Thickness Australian areas intensive agriculture Layer 1 (Horizon - top-soil) (derived soil mapping) Custodian CSIRO, Land & Water Jurisdiction Australia Description Abstract Surface predicted Thickness soil layer 1 (Horizon - top-soil) surface intensive agricultural areas Australia. Data modelled area based observations made soil agencies State CSIRO presented .0.01 degree grid cells. Topsoils (horizons) defined surface soil layers organic matter accumulates, may include dominantly organic surface layers (O P horizons). depth topsoil important , higher organic matter contents, topsoils (horizon) generally suitable properties agriculture, including higher permeability higher levels soil nutrients. Estimates soil depths needed calculate amount soil constituent either volume mass terms (bulk density also needed) - example, volume water stored rooting zone potentially available plant use, assess total stores soil carbon Greenhouse inventory assess total stores nutrients. pattern soil depth strongly related topography - shape slope land. Deeper soils typically found river valleys soils accumulate floodplains footslopes ranges (zones deposition), soils hillslopes (zones erosion) tend shallow. Map thickness topsoil derived soil map data interpreted tables soil properties specific soil groups. quality data soil depth existing soil profile datasets questionable thickness soil horizons varies locally topography, values map units general averages. final ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces mosaic data obtained various state federal agencies. surfaces constructed best available soil survey information available time. surfaces also rely number assumptions. One area weighted mean good estimate soil attributes polygon map-unit. Another assumption made look-tables provided McKenzie et al. (2000), state territories accurately depict soil attribute values soil type. accuracy maps dependent scale original polygon data sets level soil survey taken place state. scale various soil maps used deriving map available accessing data-source grid, scale used assessment likely accuracy modelling. Atlas Australian Soils considered least accurate dataset therefore used state based data. state datasets Western Australian sub-systems, South Australian land systems NSW soil landscapes reconnaissance mapping reliable based scale. NSW soil landscapes reconnaissance mapping use one dominant soil type per polygon estimation attributes. South Australia Western Australia use several soil types per polygon map-unit. digital map data provided geographical coordinates based World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum. raster data set grid resolution 0.001 degrees (approximately equivalent 1.1 km). data set product National Land Water Resources Audit (NLWRA) base dataset.

Attribute Accuracy Input attribute accuracy areas highly variable. predictive variable much lower attribute accuracy due irregular distribution limited positional accuracy parameters used modelling. several sources error estimating soil depth thickness horizons look-tables. thickness used sparingly Factual Key, estimations thickness look-tables made using empirical correlations particular soil types. quality data soil depth existing soil profile datasets questionable, soil mapping, thickness soil horizons varies locally topography, values map units general averages. definition depth soil regolith imprecise can difficult determine lower limit soil. assumption made area weighted mean soil attribute values based soil type good estimation soil property debatable, supply soil attribute value given location. Rather designed show national regional patterns soil properties. use surfaces farm catchment scale modelling may prove inaccurate.

Rather it is designed to show national and regional patterns in soil #> properties. The use of the surfaces at farm or catchment scale modelling may prove inaccurate. Also #> the use of look-up tables to attribute soil types is only as accurate as the number of observations #> used to estimate a attribute value for a soil type.

If a soil type is a dominant one within a polygon or map-unit, but is not listed #> within the look-up table or is not attributed within the look-up table then the final soil #> attribute value for that polygon will be biased towards the minor soil types that do exist.
