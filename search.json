Data #> modelled from area based observations made by soil agencies both State and #> CSIRO and presented as .0.01 degree grid cells. #>  #> Topsoils (A horizons) are defined as the surface soil layers in which organic #> matter accumulates, and may include dominantly organic surface layers (O and P #> horizons). #>  #> The depth of topsoil is important because, with their higher organic matter #> contents, topsoils (A horizon) generally have more suitable properties for #> agriculture, including higher permeability and higher levels of soil nutrients. #>  #> Estimates of soil depths are needed to calculate the amount of any soil #> constituent in either volume or mass terms (bulk density is also needed) - for #> example, the volume of water stored in the rooting zone potentially available #> for plant use, to assess total stores of soil carbon for Greenhouse inventory #> or to assess total stores of nutrients. #>  #> The pattern of soil depth is strongly related to topography - the shape and #> slope of the land.  Deeper soils are typically found in the river valleys where #> soils accumulate on floodplains and at the footslopes of ranges (zones of #> deposition), while soils on hillslopes (zones of erosion) tend to be shallow. #> Map of thickness of topsoil was derived from soil map data and interpreted #> tables of soil properties for specific soil groups. #>  #> The quality of data on soil depth in existing soil profile datasets is #> questionable and as the thickness of soil horizons varies locally with #> topography, values for map units are general averages. #>  #> The final ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces are a mosaic of all of the data #> obtained from various state and federal agencies. The surfaces have been #> constructed with the best available soil survey information available at the #> time. The surfaces also rely on a number of assumptions. One being that an area #> weighted mean is a good estimate of the soil attributes for that polygon or #> map-unit. Another assumption made is that the look-up tables provided by #> McKenzie et al. (2000), state and territories accurately depict the soil #> attribute values for each soil type. #>  #> The accuracy of the maps is most dependent on the scale of the original polygon #> data sets and the level of soil survey that has taken place in each state.  The #> scale of the various soil maps used in deriving this map is available by #> accessing the data-source grid, the scale is used as an assessment of the #> likely accuracy of the modelling.  The Atlas of Australian Soils is considered #> to be the least accurate dataset and has therefore only been used where there #> is no state based data.  Of the state datasets Western Australian sub-systems, #> South Australian land systems and NSW soil landscapes and reconnaissance #> mapping would be the most reliable based on scale. NSW soil landscapes and #> reconnaissance mapping use only one dominant soil type per polygon in the #> estimation of attributes.  South Australia and Western Australia use several #> soil types per polygon or map-unit. #>  #> The digital map data is provided in geographical coordinates based on the World #> Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum.

The vertical accuracy is not relevant. The positional assessment has #> been made by considering the tools used to generate the locational information #> and contacting the data providers. #>  #> The other parameters used in the production of the led surface have a range of #> positional accuracy ranging from + - 50 m to + - kilometres.  This contribute #> to the loss of attribute accuracy in the surface. #>  #> Attribute Accuracy Input attribute accuracy for the areas is highly variable. #> The predictive has a variable and much lower attribute accuracy due to the #> irregular distribution and the limited positional accuracy of the parameters #> used for modelling. #>  #> There are several sources of error in estimating soil depth and thickness of #> horizons for the look-up tables.  Because thickness is used sparingly in the #> Factual Key, estimations of thickness in the look-up tables were made using #> empirical correlations for particular soil types.  The quality of data on soil #> depth in existing soil profile datasets is questionable, in soil mapping, #> thickness of soil horizons varies locally with topography, so values for map #> units are general averages.  The definition of the depth of soil or regolith is #> imprecise and it can be difficult to determine the lower limit of soil. #>  #> The assumption made that an area weighted mean of soil attribute values based #> on soil type is a good estimation of a soil property is debatable, in that it #> does not supply the soil attribute value at any given location. Rather it is #> designed to show national and regional patterns in soil properties. The use of #> the surfaces at farm or catchment scale modelling may prove inaccurate. Also #> the use of look-up tables to attribute soil types is only as accurate as the #> number of observations used to estimate a attribute value for a soil type. Some #> soil types in the look-up tables may have few observations, yet the average #> attribute value is still taken as the attribute value for that soil type. #> Different states are using different taxonomic schemes making a national soil #> database difficult. Another downfall of the area weighted approach is that some #> soil types may not be listed in look-up tables. If a soil type is a dominant #> one within a polygon or map-unit, but is not listed within the look-up table or #> is not attributed within the look-up table then the final soil attribute value #> for that polygon will be biased towards the minor soil types that do exist. #> This may also happen when a large area is occupied by a soil type which has no #> B horizon. In this case the final soil attribute value will be area weighted on #> the soils with a B horizon, ignoring a major soil type within that polygon or #> map-unit. The layer 2 surfaces have large areas of no-data because all soils #> listed for a particular map-unit or polygon had no B horizon. #>  #> Logical Consistency Surface is fully logically consistent as only one parameter #> is shown, as predicted average Soil Thickness within each grid cell #>  #> Completeness Surface is nearly complete.  There are some areas (about %1 #> missing) for which insufficient parameters were known to provide a useful #> prediction and thus attributes are absent in these areas. #>  #> Contact Information Contact Organisation (s) CSIRO, Land & Water #>  #> Contact Position Project Leader #>  #> Mail Address ACLEP, GPO 1666 #>  #> Locality Canberra #>  #> State ACT #>  #> Country AUSTRALIA #>  #> Postcode 2601 #>  #> Telephone 02 6246 5922 #>  #> Facsimile 02 6246 5965 #>  #> Electronic Mail Address neil.mckenzie@cbr.clw.csiro.au #>  #> Metadata Date Metadata Date 2001-07-01 #>  #> Additional Metadata Additional Metadata #>  #> Entity and Attributes Entity Name Soil Thickness Layer 1 (derived from mapping) #>  #> Entity description Estimated Soil Thickness (mm) of Layer 1 on a cell by cell #> basis #>  #> Feature attribute name VALUE #>  #> Feature attribute definition Predicted average Thickness (mm) of soil layer 1 #> in the 0.01 X 0.01 degree quadrat #>  #> Data Type Spatial representation type RASTER #>  #> Projection Map projection GEOGRAPHIC #>  #> Datum WGS84 #>  #> Map units DECIMAL DEGREES #>  #> Scale Scale/ resolution 1:1 000 000 #>  #> Usage Purpose Estimates of soil depths are needed to calculate the amount of #> any soil constituent in either volume or mass terms (bulk density is also #> needed) - for example, the volume of water stored in the rooting zone #> potentially available for plant use, to assess total stores of soil carbon for #> Greenhouse inventory or to assess total stores of nutrients. #>  #> Provide indications of probable Thickness soil layer 1 in agricultural areas #> where soil thickness testing has not been carried out #>  #> Use Use Limitation This dataset is bound by the requirements set down by the #> National Land & Water Resources Audit"},{"path":"https://adamhsparks.github.io/read.abares/authors.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Authors","title":"Authors and Citation","text":"Adam H.
