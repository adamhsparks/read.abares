Dataset ANZLIC ID ANZCW1202000149 Title Soil Thickness Australian areas intensive agriculture Layer 1 (Horizon - top-soil) (derived soil mapping) Custodian CSIRO, Land & Water Jurisdiction Australia Description Abstract Surface predicted Thickness soil layer 1 (Horizon - top-soil) surface intensive agricultural areas Australia. Data modelled area based observations made soil agencies State CSIRO presented .0.01 degree grid cells. Topsoils (horizons) defined surface soil layers organic matter accumulates, may include dominantly organic surface layers (O P horizons). depth topsoil important , higher organic matter contents, topsoils (horizon) generally suitable properties agriculture, including higher permeability higher levels soil nutrients. Estimates soil depths needed calculate amount soil constituent either volume mass terms (bulk density also needed) - example, volume water stored rooting zone potentially available plant use, assess total stores soil carbon Greenhouse inventory assess total stores nutrients. pattern soil depth strongly related topography - shape slope land. Deeper soils typically found river valleys soils accumulate floodplains footslopes ranges (zones deposition), soils hillslopes (zones erosion) tend shallow. Map thickness topsoil derived soil map data interpreted tables soil properties specific soil groups. quality data soil depth existing soil profile datasets questionable thickness soil horizons varies locally topography, values map units general averages. final ASRIS polygon attributed surfaces mosaic data obtained various state federal agencies. surfaces constructed best available soil survey information available time. surfaces also rely number assumptions. One area weighted mean good estimate soil attributes polygon map-unit. Another assumption made look-tables provided McKenzie et al. (2000), state territories accurately depict soil attribute values soil type. accuracy maps dependent scale original polygon data sets level soil survey taken place state. scale various soil maps used deriving map available accessing data-source grid, scale used assessment likely accuracy modelling. Atlas Australian Soils considered least accurate dataset therefore used state based data. state datasets Western Australian sub-systems, South Australian land systems NSW soil landscapes reconnaissance mapping reliable based scale. NSW soil landscapes reconnaissance mapping use one dominant soil type per polygon estimation attributes. South Australia Western Australia use several soil types per polygon map-unit. digital map data provided geographical coordinates based World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum. raster data set grid resolution 0.001 degrees (approximately equivalent 1.1 km). data set product National Land Water Resources Audit (NLWRA) base dataset.

The surfaces have been constructed with the best #> available soil survey information available at the time. The surfaces also rely on a number #> of assumptions. One being that an area weighted mean is a good estimate of the soil #> attributes for that polygon or map-unit. Another assumption made is that the look-up tables #> provided by McKenzie et al. (2000), state and territories accurately depict the soil #> attribute values for each soil type. #>  #> The accuracy of the maps is most dependent on the scale of the original polygon data sets and #> the level of soil survey that has taken place in each state.  The scale of the various soil #> maps used in deriving this map is available by accessing the data-source grid, the scale is #> used as an assessment of the likely accuracy of the modelling.  The Atlas of Australian Soils #> is considered to be the least accurate dataset and has therefore only been used where there #> is no state based data.  Of the state datasets Western Australian sub-systems, South #> Australian land systems and NSW soil landscapes and reconnaissance mapping would be the most #> reliable based on scale.
