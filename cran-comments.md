## Note on URLs in package documentation

- Some URLs will be flagged with this message, "**Stream error in the HTTP/2 framing layer [www.agriculture.gov.au]**". I've checked everything a few times and have found that this is likely due to a server misconfiguration. You will see that it is always the same server. I have taken steps to address this issue within the package so that the downloads are robust and work as intended. Browsing the URL with a web browser will return the requested page with no issues.
