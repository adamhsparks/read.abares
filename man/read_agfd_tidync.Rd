\details{
From the \href{https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-survey-data/australian-gridded-farm-data}{ABARES website}:
\dQuote{The Australian Gridded Farm Data (\acronym{AGFD}) are a set of national
scale maps containing simulated data on historical broadacre farm business
outcomes including farm profitability on an 0.05-degree (approximately 5 km)
grid.\cr
These data have been produced by \acronym{ABARES} as part of the ongoing
Australian Agricultural Drought Indicator (\acronym{AADI}) project
(previously known as the Drought Early Warning System Project) and were
derived using \acronym{ABARES}
\href{https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/climate/drought/farmpredict}{\emph{farmpredict}}
model, which in turn is based on ABARES Agricultural and Grazing Industries
Survey (\acronym{AAGIS}) data.\cr

model, which in turn is based on ABARES \href{https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-definitions-methods}{Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey}
(\acronym{AAGIS}) data.\cr
These maps provide estimates of farm business profit, revenue, costs and
production by location (grid cell) and year for the period 1990-91 to
2022-23. The data do not include actual observed outcomes but rather model
predicted outcomes for representative or \sQuote{typical} broadacre farm
businesses at each location considering likely farm characteristics and
prevailing weather conditions and commodity prices.}\cr

Both sets of data are large in file size, \emph{i.e.}, >1GB, and will require time
to download.
