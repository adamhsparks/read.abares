\description{
Automates downloading and importing of \acronym{ABS} broadacre crop
production data. Please view the comments embedded in the spreadsheets
themselves (that really should be columns of comments on the data) for

latest available spreadsheet to download and open in Excel.

\details{
Technically these data are from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(\acronym{ABS}, not \acronym{ABARES}, but the data is agricultural and so
it's serviced in this package.
