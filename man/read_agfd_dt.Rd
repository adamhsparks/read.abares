\details{
From the \href{https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-survey-data/australian-gridded-farm-data}{ABARES website}:
\dQuote{The Australian Gridded Farm Data (\acronym{AGFD}) are a set of national
scale maps containing simulated data on historical broadacre farm business
outcomes including farm profitability on an 0.05-degree (approximately 5 km)
grid.\cr
These data have been produced by \acronym{ABARES} as part of the ongoing
Australian Agricultural Drought Indicator (\acronym{AADI}) project
(previously known as the Drought Early Warning System Project) and were
derived using \acronym{ABARES}
\href{https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/climate/drought/farmpredict}{\emph{farmpredict}}
model, which in turn is based on ABARES Agricultural and Grazing Industries
Survey (\acronym{AAGIS}) data.\cr

\href{https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/climate/drought/farmpredict}{\emph{farmpredict}}
model, which in turn is based on ABARES \href{https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-definitions-methods}{Agricultural and Grazing Industries Survey}
(\acronym{AAGIS}) data.\cr
These maps provide estimates of farm business profit, revenue, costs and
production by location (grid cell) and year for the period 1990-91 to
2022-23. The data do not include actual observed outcomes but rather model
predicted outcomes for representative or \sQuote{typical} broadacre farm
businesses at each location considering likely farm characteristics and
prevailing weather conditions and commodity prices.}\cr

Both sets of data are large in file size, \emph{i.e.}, >1GB, and will require time
to download.

\section{Model scenarios}{

\subsection{Historical climate (fixed prices)}{

The Historical climate (fixed prices) scenario is similar to that described
in Hughes \emph{et al.} (2022) and is intended to isolate the effects of climate
variability on financial incomes for broadacre farm businesses. In these
simulations, global output and input price indexes are fixed at values from
the most recently completed financial year. However, in these scenarios the
spread between domestic and global grain (wheat, barley and sorghum) prices,
along with Australian fodder prices are allowed to vary in response to
climate data (to capture domestic increases in grain and fodder prices in
drought years, see Hughes \emph{et al.} 2022). A 33-year historical climate
sequence (including historical simulated crop and pasture data from the
\acronym{AADI} project) is simulated for each grid cell (1990-91 to
2022-23).
}

\subsection{Historical climate and prices}{

As part of the AADI project an additional scenario was developed accounting
for changes in both climate conditions and output and input prices (\emph{i.e.},
global commodity market variability). In this historical climate and prices
scenario the 33-year reference period allows for variation in both\
historical climate conditions and historical prices. For this scenario,
historical price indexes were de-trended, to account for consistent long-
term trends in some real commodity prices (particularly sheep and lamb). The
resulting simulation results and percentile indicators are intended to
reflect the combined impacts of annual climate and commodity price
variability."

\section{Data files}{


Simulation output data are saved as multilayer NetCDF files, which are named
using following convention:

\var{f<farm year>.c<climate year>.p<price year>.t<technology year>.nc}

where:
\itemize{
\item \var{<farm year>} = Financial year of farm business data is used in simulations.
\item \var{<climate year>} = Financial year of climate data is used in simulations.
\item \var{<price year>} = Financial year of output and input prices used in simulations.
\item \var{<technology year>} = Financial year of farm \sQuote{technology} (equal to farm year in all simulations)
Here financial years are referred to by the closing calendar year
(\emph{e.g.}, 2022 = 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022).
}

Economics and Sciences (2024)}
