\usage{
read_clum_stars(data_set = "clum_50m_2023_v2", x = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_set}{A string value indicating the data desired for download. One
of:
\describe{
\item{clum_50m_2023_v2}{Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023 version 2}
\item{scale_date_update}{Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia - Date and Scale of Mapping}
}.}

\item{x}{A file path providing the file with the data to be imported. The
file is assumed to be unarchived (\emph{i.e.}, still zipped). This function does
not provide any checking whether this function is the proper function for
the provided file.  Defaults to \code{NULL}, assuming that the file will be
downloaded in the active \R session.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[stars:read_stars]{stars::read_stars()}}, for \emph{e.g.},
\code{RAT} if you wish to set the active category when loading any of the
available GeoTIFF files that are encoded with a raster attribute table.}
}
\value{
a \CRANpkg{stars} object that may be one or many layers depending
upon the requested data set.

"The Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2023
version 2 dataset is the national compilation of catchment scale land use
data available for Australia (CLUM), as at December 2023. It replaces the
Catchment Scale Land Use of Australia – Update December 2020. It is a
seamless raster dataset that combines land use data for all state and
territory jurisdictions, compiled at a resolution of 50 metres by 50 metres.
The CLUM data shows a single dominant land use for a given area, based on the
primary management objective of the land manager (as identified by state and
territory agencies). Land use is classified according to the Australian Land
Use and Management Classification version 8. It has been compiled from vector
land use datasets collected as part of state and territory mapping programs
and other authoritative sources, through the Australian Collaborative Land
Use and Management Program. Catchment scale land use data was produced by
combining land tenure and other types of land use information including,
fine-scale satellite data, ancillary datasets, and information collected in
the field. The date of mapping (2008 to 2023) and scale of mapping (1:5,000
to 1:250,000) vary, reflecting the source data, capture date and scale.
Date and scale of mapping are provided in supporting datasets."

\note{
The raster will load with the default category for each data set, but you can
specify a different category to use by passing the \code{RAT} argument through
the \code{...}.  To see which categories are available, please refer
to the metadata for these data.  The \acronym{PDF} can be accessed in your
default \acronym{PDF} viewer by using \code{\link[=view_nlum_metadata_pdf]{view_nlum_metadata_pdf()}}.
