}}

\item{year}{A string value providing the year of interest to download.

recent release available. Defaults to \code{"latest"}.}

\item{file}{A string value providing a file path to an \acronym{ABS}
Australian production data set that you have downloaded and saved locally.
No checks are performed, it will attempt to parse any file you pass to it

\description{
Automates downloading and importing of \acronym{ABS} broadacre crop
production data. Please view the comments embedded in the spreadsheets
themselves (that really should be columns of comments on the data) for
important information. The \code{source} link provides a direct download for the
latest available spreadsheet to download and open in Excel.
}
\details{
Technically these data are from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(\acronym{ABS}, not \acronym{ABARES}, but the data is agricultural and so
it's serviced in this package.
